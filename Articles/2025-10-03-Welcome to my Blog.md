**Welcome to my Blog**

#Personal #Writing

**Published: October 3rd, 2025**

**A new place for me to write about whatever crosses my mind, from technology to physics. Beginning a new blog is a wonderful step for me articulating ideas in a written format.**

This blog will mostly feature content focused around technology in the form of tools that I am building mostly using Swift and Web Technologies but sometimes delving into other things such as POSIX shell and Systems Level programming with C. Physics is also a topic I will be studying in the coming terms and would likely include some notes on this kind of thing as I find it to be very interesting and am excited about learning it to a deeper level.
